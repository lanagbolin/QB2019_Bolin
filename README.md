Hello! I'm a second year PhD student in Jen Lau's lab. I study the evolutionary ecology of plant-microbe interactions, looking at how soil microbes influence plant plasticity, selection on plant traits, and plant ecological interactions. Before I started doing science I interned at a recording studio, started a non-profit band that played free shows for underserved communities across the country, and was a semi-professional juggler. I even have a world record in "joggling" - jogging while juggling! I currently play in a band with my labbies. It's an all-girl Eagles cover band called "The Shealges." We're ok...  

Course Expectations: 
1. Learn how to use GitHub to version control R scripts  
2. Learn how to use GitHub to work on manuscripts (and convince Jen to use it, too...)  
3. Learn how to wrangle large datasets  
4. Become familiar with community data analysis techniques - knowing something is possible is half the battle!
